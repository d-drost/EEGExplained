    "Accordingly, an EEG is a device that writes electric brain signals.\n",
    "You may already know, that the brain sends electric signals along the neurons' axons. \n",
    "There are plenty of neurons and they send many tiny signals per second. \n",
    "If researchers want to measure these signals, there are different ways to do that, each of which has advantages and disadvantages. \n",
    "If you want to measure the signal very precisely on the basis of single neurons, you have to cut open the head and implement tiny measurement tools. \n",
    "This is done in animals most often, because human's don't want their heads to be cut open. \n",
    "The EEG however, doesn't need any operation beforehand, which is why we call it a <b>non-invasive method</b>. \n",

    "I already mentioned, that the EEG measures electric signals of neurons, and it does that from outside of the skull. \n",
    "If a single neurons sends an electric signal, we would never be able to record this from the outside of the skull, though, because it would be way too small. \n",
    "However, if many neurons send electric signals at the same time, they sum up and this can be measured from the outside with sensitive electrodes. \n",
    "This is what the EEG does. \n",
    "It is important to understand, that the EEG doesn't record <i>all</i> the brain activity but just the very strong highlights. \n",

    "For example (and strongly simplified), the back part of the prain (the so-called occpital region) is associated with processing visual information, while the frontal part is responsible for deliberate and conscious thought. \n",
    "Due to that structure, it makes sense to place electrodes at different locations on the skull to measure these differences. \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Additionally, multiple electrodes allow to measure a signal more reliably. \n",

    "<br>\n",
    "There are some important consequences from that. <b>First</b>, due to different references, you may not be able to compare the exact values of eeg data between experiments or participants. \n",
    "If a scientific paper reports that they measured a signal of <i>5μV</i>, you might get a different value if you do the same experiment, because of a different reference. \n",
    "However, if they report that this signal is much higher than the surounding signals (say, 5μV vs. 1μV), you would still get the same result in relative terms (say, 50μV vs. 10μV). \n",
    "Similar cases appear when you compare different participants. One participant may yield lower values than another (e.g., because of a thicker skull), but in both you may see the same relative peaks in brain activity when presenting a stimulus. \n",

    "The <b>second</b> consequence of the relative notion of voltage is, that even the <i>signs</i> may differ depending on the reference. \n",
    "When you compare your height to the Mount Everest, you will get a negative value (-7496m), when you compare to the sea level, you get a positive value (+1350m). \n",

    "In general $N=f_s * t$, where $f_s$ is the sampling frequency and $t$ is the time in seconds. \n",

    "Don't make the mistake to think that the signal contains the frequencies 12Hz and 21Hz now!\n",
