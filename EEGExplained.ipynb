    "Accordingly, an EEG is a device that writes electric brain signals.\n",
    "You may already know, that the brain sends electric signals along the neurons' axons. \n",
    "There are plenty of neurons and they send many tiny signals per second. \n",
    "If researchers want to measure these signals, there are different ways to do that, each of which has advantages and disadvantages. \n",
    "If you want to measure the signal very precisely on the basis of single neurons, you have to cut open the head and implement tiny measurement tools. \n",
    "This is done in animals most often, because human's don't want their heads to be cut open. \n",
    "The EEG however, doesn't need any operation beforehand, which is why we call it a <b>non-invasive method</b>. \n",

    "If a single neuron sends an electric signal, we would never be able to record this from the outside of the skull, though, because it would be way too small. \n",
    "However, if many neurons send electric signals at the same time, they sum up and this can be measured from the outside with sensitive electrodes. \n",
    "This is what the EEG does. \n",

    "Due to that structure, it makes sense to place electrodes at different locations on the skull to measure these differences. \n",

    "You can understand the amplitude as a measure of the energy. The higher the amplitude, the more energy a signal has. You can easily recognize this, when you hear music. A higher amplitude means a louder sound and that is more energy. \n",
    "You don't need to care why exactly we have to square the amplitude (this is just physics), but be aware that squaring a high amplitude also leads to high power.\n",

    "Naturally, waves with higher frequencies contain more energy, which would make it unfair to compare a wave of, say 50Hz with one of 1Hz directly. Dividing by the frequency mitigates this problem. \n",

    "<br> It is crucial to understand, that electric voltage is not an absolute value but always needs to be compared to a reference. \n",
    "Imagine you are standing on top of a hill and you want to know how high you are. \n",
    "You can not determine your height in absolute terms, but you always need a reference. \n",
    "Maybe you are 1200m above the ground of the nearby valey. But at the same time you are 1350m above the sea level. \n",
    "You are also 7496m below the top of the Mount Everest. You see, different points of reference give you different values for your height. \n",
    "Note that all of those are correct and convey the same information! If you know that you are 7496m below the Mount Everest and you know that the Mount Everest is 8848m high compared to the sea level, you can calculate how high you are compared to the sea level as well.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Something similar happens when you talk about voltage. \n",
    "You can't just say <i>this sensors measured 5μV</i>, but you always need to set it in relation to a reference point. \n",
    "You could say <i>this sensor measured 5μV more than the reference sensor behind the ear.</i>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "There are some important consequences from that. <b>First</b>, due to different references, you may not be able to compare the exact values of eeg data between experiments or participants. \n",
    "If a scientific paper reports that they measured a signal of <i>5μV</i>, you might get a different value if you do the same experiment, because of a different reference. \n",
    "However, if they report that this signal is much higher than the surounding signals (say, 5μV vs. 1μV), you would still get the same result in relative terms (say, 50μV vs. 10μV). \n",
    "Similar cases appear when you compare different participants. One participant may yield lower values than another (e.g., because of a thicker skull), but in both you may see the same relative peaks in brain activity when presenting a stimulus. \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The <b>second</b> consequence of the relative notion of voltage is, that even the <i>signs</i> may differ depending on the reference. \n",
    "When you compare your height to the Mount Everest, you will get a negative value (-7496m), when you compare to the sea level, you get a positive value (+1350m). \n",
    "In eeg, the same thing can happen. Hence it is important to understand, that positive and negative peaks (as shown in the following plot) contain the same kind of information: \n",

    "We will know explain the math behind the Fourier Transformation. \n",
    "First of all, we need to understand our problem statement and thereby introduce some notation. \n",
    "Recall that applying Fourier Transform means, that we have a signal and we want to know which frequencies it consists of with which weight each.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "So, we have a signal $a$, which consists of $N$ values $a[0], a[1], a[2] ... a[N-1]$. \n",
    "Be aware, that $a$ has length $N$, but $a[4]$, for example, is just a number. In the following we see such a signal (blue curve) with the two points $a[17]$ and $a[55]$ highlighted.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "im_signal_with_points = Image(value=open(\"resources/signal_with_annotations.png\", \"rb\").read(),width=400,height=600)\n",
    "\n",
    "text2 = \"\"\"\n",
    "So our signal $a$ has length $N$, which is the number of sample points. Don't confuse that with the absolute time!\n",
    "$N=100$ does not mean, that our signal is 100 seconds long. \n",
    "Instead, the relation between $N$ and the actual time in seconds is mediated by the sampling frequency we already learned about earlier. \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "If we sample with a frequency of 100Hz (i.e. 100 samples per second), a signal of length $N=300$ covers 3 seconds. \n",
    "If we sampled a signal of 20 seconds with a sampling frequency of 120 Hz, we have $N=2400$ data points.\n",
    "In general $N=f_s * t$, where $f_s$ is the sampling frequency and $t$ is the time in seconds. \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "At a later point it will become important to not confuse the indices with the actual time points, so keep this in mind!\n",

    "text = r\"\"\"\n",
    "Now that we have our signal $a$, we can introduce the main formula of the Fourier Transformation which is as follows:\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "$$\\hat{a}[k] = \\sum_{l=0}^{N-1} a[l]* e^{-2\\pi i \\frac{k*l}{N}}$$\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Don't worry, we will go over it slowly.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "This formula calculates the <b>Fourier Coefficients</b>. $\\hat{a}[k]$ is the fourier coefficient for the <b>frequency index k</b>. \n",
    "The frequency index $k$ is <b>not</b> the same as the frequency of $k$Hz, but we can calculate the frequency in Hz later. \n",
    "For the moment it is important to understand, that these coefficients $\\hat{a}[k]$ tell us, which frequencys are contained in the signals with which weight each. \n",
    "This is what we want to know, when we apply Fourier Transform. \n",
    "We will apply this formula for different values of $k$ and then we see, which frequencies have higher weights than others. \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Let's now go over the other parts of the formula. \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "$a[l]$ is the value of the signal at position $l$, which we already know from the previous panel. \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "$e$ is the euler number or exponential number.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "$i$ is the imaginary unit. \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "$k$ we already had, this is the frequency index. \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "$N$ we also know, this is the length of the signal $a$\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "We also see, that the formula inludes a sum over different values for $l$. That means, that $l$ goes from 0 to $N-1$ and the later part of the formula is sumed up for each of these values of l.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "panel_2 = HTMLMath(text)\n",
    "\n",
    "text = r\"\"\"\n",
    "Now we apply this formula for different values of $k$, i.e. we calculate $\\hat{a}[0]$ , $\\hat{a}[1]$ , $\\hat{a}[2]$ and so on.\n",
    "From this we get values like these:\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "text2 = r\"\"\"\n",
    "These are complex numbers. \n",
    "We don't go into detail on what exactly that means, but you should be aware, that the result of a Fourier Transformation includes such numbers. \n",
    "From these complex numbers, different kinds of information can be extracted. \n",
    "The most important one we get when we calcualte the absolute values of the complex numbers. \n",
    "Now the numbers look like this:\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "text3 = r\"\"\"\n",
    "If we plot this for the different values of $k$, we get this result:\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "text4 = r\"\"\"\n",
    "Does that look familiar to you? It should, because we have already seen such plots earlier. \n",
    "This plot tells us, that our signal $a$ consists of two frequencies (because of the two peaks), and the one is approximately twice as strong as the other (because the peak is twice as big).\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "This is already very close to what we wanted to know. However, there is one step to do still!\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The two peaks are at the positions $k=12$ and $k=21$. \n",
    "Don't make the mistake to think that the signal contains the frequencies 12Hz and 21Hz now!\n",
    "$k$ is the <i>frequency index</i>, not the frequency in Hz, as we already mentioned earlier. \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "To get the frequency in Hz, we need this formula:\n",
    "$$ \\frac{k*f_s}{N}$$\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "All the components we already know: $k$ is the frequency index, $f_s$ is the sampling frequency and $N$ is the length of the signal. \n",
    "For $k=12$ and $k=24$ we get values of 4 and 7 with this formula. \n",
    "Now we know that the signal $a$ can be constructed by signals of 4 and 7 Hz, where the 4Hz signal is twice as big as the 7Hz signal. \n",
